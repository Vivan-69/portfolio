# 🎨 My 3D Portfolio

Hey! Welcome to my portfolio website. I built this to showcase my work in a way that's a bit more fun and interactive than a standard resume. It's like a little corner of the internet where you can see what I've been working on.

If you're curious about the code or want to run this yourself, you're in the right place!

## ✨ What's Inside?

This isn't just a static page. I wanted to experiment with some cool web technologies, so here's what you'll find:

-   **A 3D World**: When you land on the page, you'll see a 3D background. That's built with Three.js. It's interactive, so feel free to look around!
-   **My Work**: I've got a section dedicated to my recent projects. You can click on them to learn more.
-   **Smooth Navigation**: The navigation bar floats and follows you as you scroll, making it easy to get around.
-   **Contact Me**: There's a simple form at the bottom if you want to reach out.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood (For the Techies)

If you're a developer (or just aspiring to be one), here's the tech stack I chose and why:

-   **Next.js 16**: My go-to framework for building fast, modern React apps.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For styling. It handles all the colors, spacing, and responsive layout without me having to write a million CSS files.
-   **Three.js & React Three Fiber**: This is the magic behind the 3D graphics. It lets me put 3D objects right into the website.
-   **Framer Motion**: Gives everything those smooth animations when elements appear or move.
-   **TypeScript**: Keeps my code safe and less prone to silly bugs.

## 🚀 How to Run This on Your Computer

Want to see this running locally? Follow these steps:

1.  **Grab the Code**: First, you'll need to download (clone) this repository.
2.  **Install the Tools**: Open your terminal (command prompt) in the project folder and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (This downloads all the libraries I used like React, Next.js, etc.)

3.  **Start the Engine**: Once that's done, type:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **View It**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the site live!

## 📂 Where is Everything?

If you're looking through the files:

-   `src/app`: This is where the main pages live. `page.tsx` is the homepage.
-   `src/components`: These are the building blocks, like the `Hero` section, the `Grid`, and the `ContactForm`.
-   `src/lib`: Just some helper code to make things run smoothly.

## 👋 Say Hi!

If you use this code or just like the site, let me know! I'm always open to feedback or just a friendly chat.
